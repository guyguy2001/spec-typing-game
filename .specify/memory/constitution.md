# spec-typing-game Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Uncompromising Code Quality
All code must be clear, maintainable, and adhere to established style guides. Code should be written to be easily understood by other developers, prioritizing readability and simplicity over cleverness.

### II. Rigorous Testing Standards
A comprehensive suite of tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) is mandatory for all features. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is the preferred methodology to ensure that requirements are met and the codebase remains robust.

### III. Flexible Design Exploration
The system's architecture must support iterative development and experimentation. Employ modular design and dependency injection to allow for components to be easily swapped or refactored, enabling efficient exploration of the design space.

### IV. Performance by Design
Performance is a core requirement, not an afterthought. Performance goals and metrics must be defined early in the development process, and all implementation choices should be weighed against their performance impact.

## Development Workflow

The standard workflow for introducing features is to progress through specification, planning, task breakdown, and finally implementation. This ensures clarity and alignment before code is written.

## Governance

All code contributions must be reviewed for compliance with this constitution. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit justification and approval.
