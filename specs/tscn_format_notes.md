# Introduction

This file contains notes regarding editing of tscn files by LLMs, including rules regarding common mistakes.
For full tscn syntax, see ./tscn_file_format.rst

Agent note: Whenever you try to edit a .tscn file, it breaks, and then you find a way to fix it, please add to "Format Notes" and "Rules" a note that would prevent that mistake next time. When a human developer fixes it for you, ask them if they want you to add it.

## Format Notes

## Rules

- DO NOT put comments in .tscn files - they are not supported.
