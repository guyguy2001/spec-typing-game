# Quickstart Guide: Visual Polish

This update brings the game visuals to life!

## New Visuals

*   **Characters**: You are now a **Human**, fighting **Orcs**!
*   **Targeting**: The selected enemy is highlighted by a **Red Circle** at their feet.
*   **Health Bars**: Enemies now have floating health bars so you can see their status directly.
*   **Background**: The arena now has a proper backdrop (or placeholder).

## Testing

1.  **Run**: Press F5.
2.  **Verify Sprites**: Confirm Player looks like a human and Enemy like an orc (pixel art).
3.  **Verify Targeting**: Press Tab. Confirm the red circle appears *underneath* the selected orc.
4.  **Verify Health Bars**: Damage an orc ("fire" + Space). Confirm the floating bar above its head decreases.
