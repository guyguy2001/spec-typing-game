# Quickstart Guide: Minimal Combat Loop

This guide covers the new combat loop features: Enemy AI, Respawning, and Tab Targeting.

## Gameplay Changes

*   **Enemy Attacks**: The enemy will now attack you every few seconds. Watch your health!
*   **Targeting**:
    *   **Tab**: Press `TAB` to cycle between enemies (if multiple are present).
    *   **Visuals**: A marker indicates your current target.
*   **Winning**: Defeat an enemy to spawn the next one (Wave system).
*   **Losing**: If your health hits 0, it's Game Over. Press `R` to restart.

## Testing Steps

1.  **Run the Game**: Press F5 or Play in Editor.
2.  **Wait**: Observe the enemy attacking you (Player health drops).
3.  **Fight Back**: Type "fire" to kill the enemy.
4.  **Respawn**: Verify a new enemy appears after the first one dies.
5.  **Multi-Target**: (Phase 4) Press Tab to switch targets.
6.  **Die**: Let the enemy kill you to test the Game Over screen.
